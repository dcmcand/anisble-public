It's there to ensure that companies can't track your browsing without your consent.\n\nPrivacy Badger sends the Do Not Track header with each request and evaluates the likelihood that you are still being tracked. If a domain appears to be tracking you on multiple websites, Privacy Badger automatically blocks your request from being sent to the tracking domain.\n\nOur extension shows you one of three states for each tracker. Red means block the tracker. Yellow means that we don't send cookies or referers to the tracker. Green means unblocked (probably because the third party does not appear to be tracking you - yet). You can click on the Privacy Badger icon in your browser's toolbar if you wish to override the automatic blocking settings.\n\nNothing can stop the Privacy Badger from eating cookies when it's hungry!\n\nPrivacy Badger is a project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (https://www.eff.org)","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/162/162718.png?src=api&modified=1439340939","width":"700","height":"438","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/162/162718.png?src=api&modified=1439340939","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Privacy Badger at work on the whitehouse.gov privacy policy."}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://www.eff.org/privacybadger","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/373031/privacy_badger-1.0.5-fx.xpi?src=api","size":1025037,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger-firefox/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":88,"totalDownloads":335363,"weeklyDownloads":7461,"dailyUsers":64717,"updateDate":1449205871000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadgerfirefox"},{"id":"langpack-en-GB@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"name":"English (GB) Language Pack","type":"locale","version":"44.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"},"description":null,"fullDescription":null,"isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"averageRating":3,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/english-gb-language-pack/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/english-gb-language-pack/?src=api","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/390605/english_gb_language_pack-44.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":452641,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/english-gb-language-pack/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":13,"totalDownloads":613119,"weeklyDownloads":5841,"dailyUsers":613119,"updateDate":1453772318000,"supportURL":null},{"id":"https-everywhere@eff.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-32.png?modified=1440545410","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/229/229918-64.png?modified=1440545410"},"name":"HTTPS Everywhere","type":"extension","version":"5.1.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"EFF Technologists","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/eff-technologists/?src=api"},"description":"Encrypt the web!

Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","width":"640","height":"480","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?src=api&modified=1433504323","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Unified logger"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/384466/ublock_origin-1.5.5-sm+tb+an+fx.xpi?src=api","size":1396604,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":364,"totalDownloads":2950124,"weeklyDownloads":111744,"dailyUsers":773654,"updateDate":1452495412000,"supportURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock"}]}
